Building from sources is currently supported for (at least) the following platforms :
- Qt5 on MacOS 10.12 running on an Intel (x86) Mac (platform name: `qt5-macx86`)
- Qt6 on Windows10 running MSYS2/ucrt64 development env (platform name: `qt6-ucrt64`)
- Qt6 on MacOS 12.6 running on an M1 Mac (platform name: `qt6-macm1`)

To build from source, the QGV library must be first installed :

- `git clone https://github.com/jserot/gqv`
- `cd gqv`
- `./configure -platform <platform>`
- `cd src`
- `make qmake`
- `make`
- `make dist`  (this will build the clickable apps in `<qgvdir>/lib`)

Then

- `git clone https://github.com/jserot/ssde`
- `cd ssde`
- `./configure -platform <platform> -qgvdir <qgvdir>`
- `cd src`
- `make qmake`
- `make`
- `make run`
- `make dist`  (this will build the clickable apps in `../dist/<platform>`)
